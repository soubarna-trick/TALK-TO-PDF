# TALK-TO-PDF
A Streamlit-powered application that allows users to upload a PDF file and interact with it using natural language queries. The system extracts text from the PDF, processes it into manageable chunks, and uses a combination of sentence embeddings and Google Gemini AI to retrieve and generate context-aware responses.
